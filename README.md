Motivational Quote by Albert Einstein

Wrote this very simple program to add Birthday & Anniversary details of friends & family members from an plist.

- It will read the plist file.
- Will add calendar event reading subject, name, dob (dd-mm-yyyy)
- Will also set the repeat event every year using 
- Start date is read from dob & time is added manually 10.10 am 
- End date is read from dob & time is set 30  
- Sets an alaram 1 minute before.

Cheers.
